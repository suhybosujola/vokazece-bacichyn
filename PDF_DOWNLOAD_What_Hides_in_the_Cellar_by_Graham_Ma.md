&amp;#039;God, he&amp;#039;s good.&amp;#039; Stephen King A SEVERED HEAD A grisly series of murders across London is baffling local authorities. Eyewitnesses describe suspects who are only partially visible â€“ one appears to have no feet, another no head, a fourth is missing his entire right side. A SUPERNATURAL CASE These murders are neither straightforward nor easily explained, which means there are only two people fit to investigate: DS Jamila Patel and DC Jerry Pardoe, who are used to tracking spirits intent on causing mayhem. A BLOODY HISTORY When two children go missing â€“ finding themselves lost in another time period altogether â€“ the investigation leads to the discovery of a violent entity. One who has been killing for much longer than anyone first realised â€“ and has no plans to stop... The new PATEL and PARDOE mystery. For fans of Joe Hill, Peter James and Stephen King, Graham Masterton is a master of the horror genre whose books have sold millions of copies across the globe.
