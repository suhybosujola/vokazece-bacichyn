Conan the Barbarian - a warrior from the Northern wastes of Cimmeria, fighting his way through soft-bellied Hyboria and on to the Throne. Conan is the compelling hero at the centre of a wild ride of intrigue and mayhem, stalking lands that are savage in tooth and claw. His age is a time of chaos and destruction, of empires and wizards, of battles won and loves lost. The wild Cimmerian is captured by his scheming enemies and imprisoned in dank dungeons, surrounded by monsters and haunted by his own demons. Will he escape? Will he regain his throne? In the savage land of Conan the Barbarian anything is possible. The only certainty is that success in the Hyborian age comes at a price - and that price is blood. Also known as Conan the Conqueror.
