Overview
This instant #1 internationally bestselling ‚Äúexplosive tell-all‚Äù (Daily Express, London) reveals the inside story about Meghan Markle‚Äôs journey from minor actress and attempted activist to the woman powerful enough to fracture the British Royal Family.
 
 After a childhood spent on Hollywood film sets, Meghan Markle fought hard for stardom. But even when she landed her breakthrough role on Suits, her dream of worldwide celebrity remained elusive until she met the man who would change her life‚ÄîPrince Harry. Their whirlwind romance culminated with Meghan‚Äôs ultimate fairy tale ending: their 2018 wedding at Windsor Castle. Finally, the world was her stage.
 
 It seemed that the dizzying success of the wedding between the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex marked the beginning of a fresh era for the British Royal Family. Yet, within one tumultuous year, the dream became a nightmare. In the aftermath of the infamous Megxit split and their Oprah Winfrey interview, the increasingly toxic relationship between the two Windsor sides seemed forever ruptured.
 
 What does the future hold for Meghan and Harry? And can the rest of the Windsors restore their reputation?
 
 Now, with ‚Äúnew shocking revelations‚Äù (Bella), Revenge reveals the full tangled web story of love, betrayal, secrets, and deceit within the Windsor family.
